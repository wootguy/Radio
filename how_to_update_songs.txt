1) Run MP3Gain with 105.0 target volume to sync all song volumes
2) run pack_songs.py (change vars inside first, namely the version check file)
3) Zip each pack with Store compression and upload somewhere.
4) run songlist.py and update music_packs.txt
5) copy songs.txt and music_packs.txt to the server
6) rename the FAILURE version_check/ files on the server (use same version number as in the packs)
7) wait for end of level to reload plugin so that version checking works

How version check works:
The server will send/precache the FAILURE file to clients who don't have the music pack.
When installing the music pack, the FAILURE file is overrwritten with the SUCCESS file in the pack.
Just be careful not to get this backwards.
