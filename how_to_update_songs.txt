1) Run MP3Gain with 105.0 target volume to sync all song volumes
2) run songlist.py
3) run pack_songs.py (change vars inside first, namely the version check file)
4) rename the FAILURE version_check file on the server (use same version number from previous step)
5) Zip each pack with Store compression and upload somewhere.
6) update all musicPack* CVars in server.cfg
7) music should update on level change, or you can reload the plugin if impatient.

How version check works:
The server will send/precache the FAILURE file to clients who don't have the music pack.
When installing the music pack, the FAILURE file is overrwritten with the SUCCESS file
in the pack. Just be careful not to get this backwards.
