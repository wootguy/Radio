1) Audacity export settings (I think this is the minimum before quality loss is obvious):
     Bit Rate Mode = Variable
     Quality = 65-105 kbps
     Variable speed = Fast
     Channel Mode = Joint Stereo
     Project Rate (Hz) = 22050
2) Run MP3Gain with 89.0 target volume to sync all song volumes
3) run songlist.py
5) rename the FAILURE version_check file (increase the version number or use a date or something)
6) add a new SUCCESS version_check file to the music pack (same path as in step 5)
7) update all musicPack* CVars in server.cfg
8) music should update on level change, or you can reload the plugin if impatient.

How version check works:
The server will send/precache the FAILURE file to clients who don't have the music pack.
When installing the music pack, the FAILURE file is overrwritten with the SUCCESS file
in the pack. Just be careful not to get this backwards.
